# Integrating `turbo/log` into a CMake Project

Assuming `turbo/log` was previously [built with CMake](build.mdx#cmake) or installed via a package manager, you can use the CMake command `find_package` to build against `turbo/log` in a CMake project, as shown below:

```cmake title="CMakeLists.txt"
cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.16)
project (myproj VERSION 1.0)

find_package (turbo 0.8.0 REQUIRED)

add_executable (myapp main.cpp)
target_link_libraries (myapp turbo::turbo_static)
```

The compiled target `myapp` will automatically add klog to its dependencies as needed.

Alternatively, you can use the CMake command `add_subdirectory` to include `turbo` directly from a subdirectory in your project.
Replace the `find_package` call in the previous code snippet with `add_subdirectory`.
