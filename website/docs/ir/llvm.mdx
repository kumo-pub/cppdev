# LLVM

LLVM is a **modular compiler infrastructure** and toolchain, not a parser generator.
It provides the building blocks for code representation, optimization, and generation, including support for **ASTs, IRs, and MLIR**.

---

## What It Is

- A **compiler framework** that allows you to build **custom compilers, interpreters, and code transformation tools**.
- Provides **intermediate representations (IR)**, **optimization passes**, and **code generation backends**.
- Supports **C++ APIs** for AST manipulation, IR generation, and integration with other tooling.

---

## When to Use

- **High-performance or custom language tooling**, where you need control over **code analysis, transformations, or JIT compilation**.
- **C++-heavy environments** where the tooling integrates directly with existing compiler workflows.
- Projects needing **MLIR** (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) for machine learning or specialized DSL compilation.

---

## Advantages

- Extremely **flexible and extensible**, can represent complex IRs and ASTs.
- **Wide adoption** in systems programming, ML compilers, and high-performance DSLs.
- Can be used as a **backend for custom languages**, or for **transforming/executing existing code**.

---

## Considerations

- **Not a parser**: you need a front-end (like Clang, ANTLR, PEGTL, Bison/Flex) to generate AST/IR.
- **Complexity**: High, requires deep knowledge of compiler design and LLVM APIs.
- **Use cases**: Custom compilers, DSL tooling, high-performance numerical computing, MLIR-based frameworks.

## Reference Projects

- **Codon**: a high-performance Python compiler using LLVM IR
- **Hailide**: DSL compiler leveraging LLVM for numerical computations
- **Triton**: GPU-optimized tensor compiler using LLVM backend

### Summary

- **Integration complexity**: High
- **Performance**: Excellent for compiled code and JIT pipelines
- **Typical scenarios**: Custom compiler development, MLIR pipelines, DSL execution, high-performance C++ tooling

> LLVM is a **powerful foundation**, but it requires a **parser front-end** to generate AST/IR. It is primarily used in **C++ tooling, MLIR projects, and compiler development**.
