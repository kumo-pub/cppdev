# PEGTL (Parsing Expression Grammar Template Library)

PEGTL is a **header-only C++ library** for parsing based on **Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG)**.
It provides a lightweight, efficient, and flexible solution for building parsers for expressions, DSLs, and other structured input.

---

## Repository

PEGTL is actively maintained on GitHub:

[https://github.com/taocpp/PEGTL](https://github.com/taocpp/PEGTL)

The repository includes extensive **examples** in the `examples` directory, covering expression parsing, DSLs, and more.
These examples provide practical guidance for integrating PEGTL into your C++ projects.

---

## Why PEGTL?

PEGTL is designed for **C++ ecosystems** and is suitable when:

- You need to parse **small to medium-sized expressions or DSLs**.
- You want **control over parser behavior and memory usage**.
- Integration with existing **C++ codebase** is a priority.
- Performance is important, but parsing load is **moderate**, not extreme online QPS.

It is **not intended for full SQL engines or complex grammars** that require advanced optimizations or backtracking-heavy parsing.

## Integration Complexity

- Header-only: no library linking required.
- Easy to integrate into existing C++ projects.
- Minimal dependencies, purely C++17-compatible.

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric                  | Typical Range / Notes                          |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Parsing Speed           | Very fast for small expressions, moderate for large nested grammars |
| Memory Usage            | Low, can be tightly controlled               |
| Complexity Handling     | Handles moderate recursion and backtracking efficiently |
| Scalability             | Suitable for offline compilers or internal DSL parsing |

> For extremely complex grammars or very high online request rates (thousands of QPS parsing large inputs), PEGTL may not be sufficient.

---

## Use Cases

- **Expression Evaluation**: Parsing `a + b * c` or user-defined functions.
- **Internal DSLs**: Small domain-specific languages for configuration, query fragments, or scripting.
- **Offline Code Generation**: Intermediate parser for compiler-like workflows.

---

## Comparison with Other IR Parsing Tools

- **Bison / Flex**: Better for **full SQL parsing or production-grade compilers**. More complex integration, but necessary for high-performance or large-scale grammars.
- **PEGTL**: Preferable for **small, controllable grammars**, offline tooling, or expression evaluation. Easier to integrate and maintain in C++ projects.

---

## Summary

PEGTL offers a **lightweight, header-only, C++-friendly parsing solution**.
It is best for **offline compilation, DSL processing, and expression evaluation**, where grammar size is manageable, performance is important, and full compiler complexity is unnecessary.
The **examples directory in the repository** provides practical templates to accelerate integration and learning.
