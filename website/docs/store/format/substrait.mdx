# Substrait

**Overview:**
Substrait is an open standard for representing relational algebra plans in a platform-independent way. Unlike traditional data storage formats like Parquet or Arrow, Substrait is a **plan/protocol format** rather than a serialized data format. Its primary goal is to allow **interoperable query execution** across different engines, enabling systems to share query plans without being tied to a specific backend.

**Key Features:**

* **Cross-Engine Interoperability:** Substrait allows query plans to be serialized and sent between different SQL engines or execution engines.
* **Extensible Relational Algebra Representation:** Supports standard relational operators (scan, filter, join, aggregate, sort) and allows engine-specific extensions.
* **Integration with Arrow/Parquet:** Substrait leverages Apache Arrow for in-memory columnar data representation and can reference data stored in formats like Parquet.
* **Protobuf-Based Serialization:** Plans are serialized using Protobuf, making it easy to parse and transmit across languages and platforms.

**Typical Use Cases:**

* Engine-to-engine query plan exchange (e.g., submitting a plan from a planner to a distributed execution engine).
* Standardizing cross-system optimizations.
* Query federation across heterogeneous backends without rewriting SQL.
