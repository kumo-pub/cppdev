# Apache Arrow / Feather

**Type**: In-memory columnar format / file interchange format

## Overview

Apache Arrow is a cross-language in-memory columnar data format designed for high-performance analytics and zero-copy interoperability between systems. Arrow defines both a memory layout and a lightweight file format (Feather) for disk-based storage and exchange.

Arrow is **columnar**, which means that each column is stored contiguously in memory, allowing:

- Vectorized computation on column batches.
- Cache-friendly access patterns for CPUs and SIMD instructions.
- Efficient compression and encoding.

Arrow also provides **zero-copy access**, so data can be shared across processes or languages (C++, Python, Java, Rust, etc.) without serialization/deserialization overhead.

## Key Features

- **Memory Layout**: Arrow memory layout is standardized, aligned, and supports optional null bitmaps per column for missing values.
- **Columnar Storage**: Each column is stored in contiguous memory; columns can be accessed independently.
- **Data Types**: Supports primitive types (int, float), variable-length types (strings, binary), timestamps, decimals, and nested types (structs, lists, maps).
- **Feather File**: Lightweight disk format for persistent storage and cross-language data exchange.
- **Batch Oriented**: RecordBatches allow grouping multiple rows in a columnar layout, optimizing CPU and IO throughput.
- **Cross-language**: APIs exist for C++, Python, Java, R, Go, Rust.

## Performance Considerations

- **Zero-copy reads**: Avoids memory copy when moving data between processes or languages.
- **Vectorized processing**: Enables SIMD acceleration, especially for numerical computations.
- **Compression**: Arrow supports optional compression (LZ4, ZSTD) on disk/file formats.
- **IO throughput**: Suitable for high-throughput analytics workloads; Feather files are typically smaller and faster to read/write than row-based formats like CSV.

### Example Benchmarks

| Operation | Arrow / Feather (Python) | CSV | Notes |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----|-------|
| 10M rows × 10 columns read | ~0.4 s | ~4 s | Columnar format enables 10× faster read |
| 10M rows × 10 columns write | ~0.5 s | ~4.5 s | Feather is lightweight, minimal serialization overhead |

> Actual numbers depend on hardware, compression, and language bindings.

## Integration & Use Cases

- **In-memory analytics pipelines**: Arrow buffers allow efficient computation without copy overhead.
- **ETL / Data interchange**: Feather files are fast for cross-language sharing.
- **Machine Learning pipelines**: Arrow arrays feed directly into vectorized ML computations.
- **Database engines**: Many modern engines (e.g., Velox, DuckDB) use Arrow as the internal columnar representation.

## Operational Notes

- **Memory management**: Arrow arrays can be large; ensure process memory is sufficient.
- **Thread safety**: Reading is generally thread-safe; writing/updating requires care.
- **Disk persistence**: Feather files are portable, but for large-scale datasets consider partitioning or chunking to avoid memory pressure.
- **Compression trade-offs**: Higher compression reduces disk IO but increases CPU overhead.
