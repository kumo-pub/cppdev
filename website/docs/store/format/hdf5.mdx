# HDF5 Format Overview

**HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format version 5)** is a versatile, high-performance format for storing large, complex, and heterogeneous data.
It is widely used in scientific computing, machine learning, and large-scale analytics.

## 1. Key Characteristics

**Hierarchical Structure**

* HDF5 organizes data into a filesystem-like hierarchy of **groups** and **datasets**.
* Groups are like directories; datasets are like files containing arrays or tables.
* Supports **nested hierarchies** for complex data organization.

**Multi-dimensional Arrays**

* Datasets can store multi-dimensional arrays (1D, 2D, 3D, …) of numeric or string types.
* Supports **chunking** for partial I/O, enabling efficient access to subsets of large arrays.

**Metadata Support**

* Attributes can be attached to groups or datasets for descriptive metadata.
* Useful for labeling datasets, units, timestamps, or provenance information.

**Compression and Storage Efficiency**

* Built-in support for compression filters (gzip, szip, etc.) and data type conversion.
* Allows very large datasets to be stored efficiently without losing accessibility.

**Cross-platform and Language Support**

* Native libraries available for C, C++, Python (h5py), Java, and more.
* Files are portable across architectures.

## 2. Usage Scenarios

**Scientific Computing**

* Storing large simulation data (e.g., physics, climate, genomics).
* Organizing experiments with multiple datasets and time series.

**Machine Learning / AI**

* Efficient storage of large feature arrays, embeddings, or training datasets.
* Supports incremental reading and writing for high-performance pipelines.

**Data Archiving**

* Centralized storage of heterogeneous datasets with metadata for long-term access.
* Useful in research institutions and data warehouses.

**Partial Data Access**

* Supports selective reading of chunks or slices of large datasets without loading the entire file into memory.

## 3. Integration in Kumo

In Kumo Stack, HDF5 is typically used for:

* Large-scale structured data storage
* Intermediate dataset storage for batch pipelines
* Sharing multi-dimensional arrays between different processing stages

Integration considerations:

* Use chunked datasets when working with very large arrays to reduce I/O overhead
* Store metadata as attributes to simplify downstream processing
* Consider parallel HDF5 for multi-node pipelines in HPC or cloud environments

## 4. Performance Notes

**I/O Throughput**

* Chunking and compression balance between read/write speed and disk footprint
* Parallel HDF5 enables distributed read/write for cluster or cloud storage

**Memory Usage**

* Partial reading avoids loading entire datasets into memory
* Efficient for multi-gigabyte or terabyte-scale files

**Compatibility**

* HDF5 is widely supported by scientific and ML frameworks (NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Pandas)
