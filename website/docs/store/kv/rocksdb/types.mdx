# RocksDB Types and Usage Scenarios

RocksDB provides multiple **engine types** to support different workloads.
Choosing the right type is critical to achieving optimal performance for your application.

---

## 1. RocksDB Engine Types {#types}

RocksDB mainly offers the following types:

| Type | Description | Typical Scenario |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Default DB** | Standard key-value store with LSM (Log-Structured Merge Tree) engine | General-purpose storage, small to medium datasets, embedded KV |
| **TransactionDB** | Default DB with ACID transactions, supports atomic commits | Control-plane metadata, multi-key atomic updates, small transactional datasets |
| **OptimisticTransactionDB** | Lightweight transaction engine using optimistic concurrency | High-read, low-write scenarios, concurrent readers, small transactional workloads |
| **PlainTable / Universal / ColumnFamily** | Specialized storage formats or logical partitioning | High read amplification workloads, columnar storage, large datasets, complex query patterns |

---

## 2. Typical Usage Scenarios {#scenarios}

### 2.1 Default DB

- Suitable for **general-purpose KV storage**
- No transactional guarantees
- Recommended for **high throughput writes** and **bulk storage of structured data**

### 2.2 TransactionDB

- Provides **full ACID transactions**
- Useful for **metadata, configuration, and control-plane KV**
- Supports **atomic multi-key updates**
- Typical in Kumo when you need **strong consistency** guarantees

### 2.3 OptimisticTransactionDB

- Optimized for **concurrent read-heavy workloads**
- Uses **optimistic concurrency control**
- Recommended for **small transactional updates** where conflicts are rare

### 2.4 Other types (PlainTable / ColumnFamily / Universal)

- Used in **specialized performance scenarios**
- ColumnFamily allows logical separation of key spaces
- PlainTable can reduce read amplification for **very large datasets**
- Usually for **big-data analytics or log storage scenarios**

---

## Summary

- Selecting the correct RocksDB type is **key for performance and reliability**
- For **general KV** → Default DB
- For **transactional control-plane KV** → TransactionDB / OptimisticTransactionDB
- For **high-performance analytical or specialized workloads** → ColumnFamily / PlainTable
