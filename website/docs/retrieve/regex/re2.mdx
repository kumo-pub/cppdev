# RE2 – Google Regular Expressions

**Project:** [RE2 GitHub](https://github.com/google/re2)
**Language:** C++

## Overview

RE2 is a **high-performance, memory-safe regex engine** developed by Google. Unlike backtracking engines such as PCRE, RE2 guarantees **linear-time execution**, making it suitable for **online and production systems**, even when processing user-provided patterns. It avoids vulnerabilities such as **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)**.

RE2 supports a **subset of PCRE syntax**, including most standard operators, character classes, and captures, but **does not support backreferences or complex lookarounds**. Its primary design goal is **safety and predictability**, not complete Perl compatibility.

## Key Features

* **Linear-time execution:** All regex matching is guaranteed to be O(n) in input size.
* **Memory safety:** Prevents excessive stack or heap usage even for complex patterns.
* **Dynamic usage:** Patterns can be compiled at runtime and reused.
* **Capture groups:** Supports standard capturing and named groups.
* **Partial syntax coverage:** Supports most common patterns, but lacks backreferences and some advanced lookarounds.

---

## Typical Use Cases

* Online systems with **user-provided regex**, such as search engines or filtering tools.
* Large-scale text scanning, log analysis, or real-time event processing.
* Scenarios where **performance and safety** are more critical than full Perl compatibility.

## Industrial Fit

| Requirement                 | RE2 Support |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| Online, user-facing safety  | ✔️          |
| Predictable performance     | ✔️          |
| Dynamic pattern compilation | ✔️          |
| Advanced Perl-only syntax   | ❌           |
| Captures / group extraction | ✔️          |
| Memory-safe                 | ✔️          |

### C++ Example

```cpp
#include <re2/re2.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string text = "User: Alice, Score: 42";
    std::string user;
    int score;

    // Compile the regex
    RE2 pattern("User: (\\w+), Score: (\\d+)");

    // Match the text
    if (RE2::FullMatch(text, pattern, &user, &score)) {
        std::cout << "User: " << user << ", Score: " << score << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "No match found" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

* `RE2::FullMatch` checks whether the entire input matches the pattern.
* Captured groups are extracted into variables (`user` and `score`).
* RE2 guarantees **linear-time execution** regardless of input or pattern complexity.
