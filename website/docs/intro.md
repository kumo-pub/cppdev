# Overview

The kumo search C++ Core Development Library is a foundational component library tailored specifically for **server-side development**, designed to address the core requirements of high performance, stability, and maintainability in backend systems. The entire library ecosystem is managed uniformly via the **kmpkg package manager**, which streamlines dependency management, version control, and deployment workflows, significantly reducing the complexity of building and maintaining server-side projects.

Every integrated component—whether third-party dependencies or self-developed modules—consists of industry-renowned, widely recognized libraries. All of these components have undergone rigorous long-term validation in **10,000-server-scale production clusters**, demonstrating robust reliability to meet the demands of high-concurrency, high-availability server-side scenarios. This library serves as a solid, dependable technical foundation for building kumo search-related server-side applications.

The kumo search C++ Core Development Library is a server-side-focused foundational toolkit managed by kmpkg. All its integrated libraries are industry-recognized and validated in 10,000-server-scale clusters, delivering production-grade reliability for backend development.
