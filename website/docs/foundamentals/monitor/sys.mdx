# System Monitoring
`tally` provides monitoring interfaces for system metrics, which are defined in the file:
```cpp
<tally/sigar.h>
```

## Core Functions and Features
Sigar abstracts the underlying differences between various operating systems through a unified API, delivering consistent metric collection capabilities. For instance, it allows retrieving process lists or real-time CPU load using the same method on both Windows and Linux platforms.

Its data collection scope includes but is not limited to: CPU core count and utilization rate, physical and virtual memory usage, disk partition read/write speeds, network interface traffic statistics, etc. This design simplifies the complexity of multi-platform adaptation for developers.

Sigar (System Information Gatherer and Reporter) is a cross-platform system metrics component, primarily designed to collect key performance data of operating systems. It can efficiently obtain usage information of resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network, making it suitable for scenarios like operation and maintenance monitoring, security auditing, and academic research.

## Default Monitoring
The exported system monitoring metrics are defined in the file:
```cpp
<tally/sigar_metric.h>
```
Refer to the table below for the exported metrics.
