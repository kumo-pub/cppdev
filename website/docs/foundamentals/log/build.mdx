# Install from Source

## CMake

The `log` module of `kumo` is integrated into `turbo`, located in the `turbo/log` directory.

[CMake](http://www.cmake.org) can be used for compilation across a wide range of platforms. A typical workflow for building `turbo` on GNU-based Unix-like systems with `make` as the build tool is as follows:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the source directory.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/kumose/turbo.git
  cd turbo
  ```
2. Run CMake to configure the build tree.
  ```bash
  cmake -S . -B build -G "Unix Makefiles"
  ```

CMake provides different generators, and by default selects the one most relevant to the current environment. To specify a generator explicitly, use `cmake . -G <generator-name>` to generate the target build system.
Available generators can be viewed with `cmake --help`.

3. Use the generated files to compile the project.
  ```bash
  cmake --build build
  ```
4. Test the project (optional).
  ```bash
  cmake --build build --target test
  ```
5. Install the compiled files (optional).
  ```bash
  cmake --build build --target install
  ```

After successful compilation, [integrate](usage.mdx) `turbo/log` into your project.
