# Test Reporters

## Reporters

Doctest features a modular reporter/listener system that allows users to write and register their own reporters. The reporter interface can also be used to "listen" to events.

You can use ``--list-reporters`` to list all registered reporters/listeners. Several reporters are implemented in the framework:
- ```console``` - Streaming - Writes normal text lines with color if a capable terminal is detected
- ```xml``` - Streaming - Writes in an xml format customized for doctest
- ```junit``` - Buffered - Writes in JUnit-compatible xml - For more information, check [here](https://github.com/doctest/doctest/issues/318) and [here](https://github.com/doctest/doctest/issues/376).

Streaming means results are delivered incrementally, rather than at the end of the test run.

Output is written to ```stdout``` by default, but can be redirected using the ```--out=<filename>``` [**command line option**](commandline.mdx).

Example of how to define your own reporter:

```c++
#include <doctest/doctest.h>

#include <mutex>

using namespace doctest;

struct MyXmlReporter : public IReporter
{
    // caching pointers/references to objects of these types - safe to do
    std::ostream&         stdout_stream;
    const ContextOptions& opt;
    const TestCaseData*   tc;
    std::mutex            mutex;

    // constructor has to accept the ContextOptions by ref as a single argument
    MyXmlReporter(const ContextOptions& in)
            : stdout_stream(*in.cout)
            , opt(in) {}

    void report_query(const QueryData& /*in*/) override {}

    void test_run_start() override {}

    void test_run_end(const TestRunStats& /*in*/) override {}

    void test_case_start(const TestCaseData& in) override { tc = &in; }

    // called when a test case is reentered because of unfinished subcases
    void test_case_reenter(const TestCaseData& /*in*/) override {}

    void test_case_end(const CurrentTestCaseStats& /*in*/) override {}

    void test_case_exception(const TestCaseException& /*in*/) override {}

    void subcase_start(const SubcaseSignature& /*in*/) override {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
    }

    void subcase_end() override {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
    }

    void log_assert(const AssertData& in) override {
        // don't include successful asserts by default - this is done here
        // instead of in the framework itself because doctest doesn't know
        // if/when a reporter/listener cares about successful results
        if(!in.m_failed && !opt.success)
            return;

        // make sure there are no races - this is done here instead of in the
        // framework itself because doctest doesn't know if reporters/listeners
        // care about successful asserts and thus doesn't lock a mutex unnecessarily
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex);

        // ...
    }

    void log_message(const MessageData& /*in*/) override {
        // messages too can be used in a multi-threaded context - like asserts
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex);

        // ...
    }

    void test_case_skipped(const TestCaseData& /*in*/) override {}
};

// "1" is the priority - used for ordering when multiple reporters are used
REGISTER_REPORTER("my_xml", 1, MyXmlReporter);

// registering the same class as a reporter and as a listener is nonsense but it's possible
REGISTER_LISTENER("my_listener", 1, MyXmlReporter);
```

Custom `IReporter` implementations must be registered with one of the following:

* `REGISTER_REPORTER`, when the new reporter is an option that users can select at runtime.
* `REGISTER_LISTENER`, when the reporter is actually a listener and must always execute, regardless of which reporter is selected at runtime.

Multiple reporters can be used simultaneously - simply specify them via the ```--reporters=...``` [**command line filter option**](commandline.mdx), separated by commas like this: ```--reporters=myReporter,xml```. Their execution order will be based on their priority - in the case of the example reporter above, that is the number `1` (lower values mean earlier execution - the default console/xml reporters in the framework have a priority of 0, and negative values are also accepted).

All registered listeners (``REGISTER_LISTENER``) will execute before any reporters - they do not need to be specified and cannot be filtered via the command line.

When implementing a reporter, it is recommended that users follow the comments in the example above and review the small number of reporters implemented in the framework itself.
