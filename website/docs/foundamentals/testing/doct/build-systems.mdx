# Integration and Building

## Build Systems
The latest released version of doctest can be obtained from here: [`https://gitee.com/kumo-hub/doctest/raw/master/doctest/doctest.h`](https://gitee.com/kumo-hub/doctest/raw/master/doctest/doctest.h)

You can replace `master` in the URL above with tags like `dev` or `v1.4.8` for specific versions.

### CMake
- **doctest** is most easily used as a single file in your own repository. The following minimal example will then work:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
project(cmake_test VERSION 0.0.1 LANGUAGES CXX)

# Prepare doctest for other targets to use
find_package(doctest REQUIRED)

# Make test executable
add_executable(tests main.cpp)
target_compile_features(tests PRIVATE cxx_std_17)
target_link_libraries(tests PRIVATE doctest::doctest)
```

- You can also use the following CMake snippet to automatically fetch the entire **doctest** repository from Gitee and configure it as an external project:
```cmake
include(ExternalProject)
find_package(Git REQUIRED)

ExternalProject_Add(
    doctest
    PREFIX ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/doctest
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://gitee.com/kumo-hub/doctest.git
    TIMEOUT 10
    UPDATE_COMMAND ${GIT_EXECUTABLE} pull
    CONFIGURE_COMMAND ""
    BUILD_COMMAND ""
    INSTALL_COMMAND ""
    LOG_DOWNLOAD ON
)

# Expose required variable (DOCTEST_INCLUDE_DIR) to parent scope
ExternalProject_Get_Property(doctest source_dir)
set(DOCTEST_INCLUDE_DIR ${source_dir}/doctest CACHE INTERNAL "Path to include folder for doctest")
```

Later you will be able to use the doctest include directory as follows:
```cmake
# add it globally
include_directories(${DOCTEST_INCLUDE_DIR})

# or per target
target_include_directories(my_target PUBLIC ${DOCTEST_INCLUDE_DIR})
```

- If you have the entire doctest repository (as a submodule or files), you can also include it in your CMake build with ```add_subdirectory(path/to/doctest)```, then you can use it like this:
```cmake
add_executable(my_tests src_1.cpp src_2.cpp ...)
target_link_libraries(my_tests doctest)
```

- The "CMakeLists.txt" file of the doctest repository has an `install()` command, so you can also use doctest as a package.

- To discover tests from executables and register them with CTest, you can use [```doctest_discover_tests(<target>)```](https://github.com/doctest/doctest/blob/master/scripts/cmake/doctest.cmake) from `scripts/cmake/doctest.cmake` — read the comments in the file on how to use it. It works just like the same feature in [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/cmake-integration.mdx#automatic-test-registration).

### Package Managers
**doctest** is available via the following package managers:
- kmpkg
```sh
kmpkg integrate install
kmpkg install doctest
```
The doctest port in kmpkg is kept up-to-date by members of the `Kumo` team. If the version is outdated, please create an issue or pull request on the [kmpkg repository](https://gitee.com/kumo-pub/kmpkg).

- hunter
- conan
    - https://conan.io/center/doctest
    - https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/tree/master/recipes/doctest
- Homebrew (`brew install doctest`)

:::warning IMPORTANT
The version installed via kmpkg is the mirrored version of `kumo` on GITEE, while versions installed via other package managers are the official versions. There is no difference in usage.
