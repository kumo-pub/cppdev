# Hadar – Chinese Simplified/Traditional Conversion

**Project:** [Hadar GitHub](https://github.com/kumose/hadar)
**Language:** C++

## Overview

Hadar is a **high-performance Chinese text conversion engine**, designed for **Simplified ↔ Traditional Chinese** conversion. It is an upgraded evolution of **OpenCC**, maintaining the core **dictionary-based, rule-driven conversion approach** while optimizing for **speed and memory efficiency**.

The engine uses **static word/phrase dictionaries** and applies deterministic rules for conversion. It is primarily suited for **offline preprocessing, NLP pipelines, and batch text normalization**.

## Key Features

* **Simplified ↔ Traditional conversion:** Accurate conversion at **word and phrase level**, not only character-by-character.
* **Rule-driven mapping:** Handles ambiguous mappings with priority rules.
* **Static dictionaries:** Memory-efficient, fast lookup for large-scale corpora.
* **Batch processing optimized:** Capable of processing millions of characters efficiently.
* **Unicode support:** Fully supports UTF-8 encoded Chinese text.

---

## Typical Use Cases

* Preprocessing text for **Chinese NLP pipelines**.
* Normalizing **user-generated content** across Simplified and Traditional Chinese.
* Large-scale **corpus conversion** for search engines or text analytics.
* Integration into **offline or batch processing systems** requiring deterministic conversion.
