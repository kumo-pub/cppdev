# SentencePiece – Subword Tokenization

- **Project:** [SentencePiece GitHub](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece)
- **Language:** C++

## Overview

SentencePiece is a **language-independent subword tokenizer** designed for **NLP preprocessing**, especially for neural machine translation and text modeling. It converts raw text into **subword units** using statistical algorithms such as **BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding)** or **Unigram Language Model**, enabling robust handling of **OOV (out-of-vocabulary) words**.

The library treats input text as a **sequence of Unicode characters**, making it fully compatible with **any language**, including Chinese, Japanese, and multilingual corpora. It is optimized for **offline preprocessing and large-scale tokenization pipelines**.

## Key Features

* **Language-independent subword tokenization** for robust NLP preprocessing.
* **BPE and Unigram LM algorithms** for subword segmentation.
* **Model training and inference**: Train your own subword model or use pre-trained models.
* **Unicode support**: Fully compatible with UTF-8 text.
* **Deterministic tokenization**: Same input always produces the same token sequence.
* **C++ API with Python bindings**: Easy integration in pipelines.

## Typical Use Cases

* Preprocessing text for **neural machine translation (NMT)**.
* Tokenization for **language modeling** and subword embedding.
* Handling rare words and multilingual corpora in **search engines** or NLP pipelines.
* Offline or batch **text normalization and segmentation**.
