# PCRE – Perl Compatible Regular Expressions

- **Project:** [PCRE GitHub](https://github.com/PhilipHazel/pcre)
- **Language:** C/C++

## Overview

PCRE is a **full-featured regular expression library** that implements the Perl syntax and semantics. It provides **powerful pattern matching capabilities**, including lookarounds, backreferences, and advanced capture handling.

PCRE uses a **backtracking engine**, which allows flexible and expressive regex patterns but can lead to **exponential execution time** for certain pathological patterns. It is best suited for **controlled environments** where input patterns are trusted, such as batch processing or offline text analysis.

## Key Features

* **Full Perl syntax support:** Lookaheads, lookbehinds, backreferences, and conditional patterns.
* **Dynamic compilation:** Regex patterns can be compiled at runtime.
* **Capture groups:** Supports numbered and named captures.
* **Unicode support:** Handles UTF-8, UTF-16, and other encodings.
* **Flexible matching options:** Partial matches, global matches, and custom flags.

## Typical Use Cases

* Offline text processing and transformation.
* Advanced pattern matching for **logs, documents, or corpora**.
* Controlled batch analytics where performance guarantees are not critical.

## Industrial Fit

| Requirement                 | PCRE Support |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| Full Perl regex syntax      | ✔️           |
| Dynamic pattern compilation | ✔️           |
| Safe for untrusted input    | ❌            |
| Predictable performance     | ❌            |
| Capture groups              | ✔️           |
| Unicode support             | ✔️           |

## C++ Example

```cpp
#include <pcre.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    const char* pattern = "User: (\\w+), Score: (\\d+)";
    const char* subject = "User: Alice, Score: 42";
    const char* error;
    int erroffset;

    pcre* re = pcre_compile(pattern, 0, &error, &erroffset, nullptr);
    if (!re) return 1;

    int ovector[30];
    int rc = pcre_exec(re, nullptr, subject, strlen(subject), 0, 0, ovector, 30);
    if (rc >= 0) {
        std::cout.write(subject + ovector[2], ovector[3] - ovector[2]);
        std::cout << " ";
        std::cout.write(subject + ovector[4], ovector[5] - ovector[4]);
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }

    pcre_free(re);
    return 0;
}
```
